This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web app. You can follow my design process on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/7CQBA0EwAEx7YvXiFRIskO/Website?node-id=0%3A1&t=2exI8fWz6AsemVWX-1).

# What's The Tech Stack?

This project has been bootstrapped using [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). In such, the Next framework is at the core of this technical stack. The primary functionality has been written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), Microsoft's statically typed extension of JavaScript. This has been chosen to catch errors in code early on and for the ease of development that comes from modern IDE's autocompletion.

## Running the development environment.

To run the development server, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the development server is running, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser of choice.

## Deploying to production.

This project is currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/JyeStillitano/jyestillitano.github.io).

The project has been setup with a Next.js YAML template to, on push to main, automatically build and deploy to a free GitHub Pages website, currently using the default domain [https://jyestillitano.github.io/](https://jyestillitano.github.io/).
